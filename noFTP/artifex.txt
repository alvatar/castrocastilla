The concept of this work is based on the self-organization of several natural processes in nature: ant nests taking shape without master plan -only the interaction of the ants aware of their own work-, flocks of birds grouping into complex patterns in the air -without a leader or choreography-, or formation of mineral crystals, snowflakes and many other examples in biology, chemistry, sociology or economics... etc. Self-organization is a fascinating characteristic, almost magical: without being guided by an external source, such systems increase the complexity of internal structures to generate patterns only understandable on a larger scale. This scale leap is where and when everything happens, allowing to observe the phenomenon. Artifex wants to see this moment, wants to inspect the formation of structures in time of their appearance, etc.

The work consists of a program that displays a collection of millions of interconnected micro-programs, coexisting in the "ecosystem" of the computer's memory, with a code and parameters that define them. However, the same way but now within an artificial system, the behavior will emerge the set of complex temporal and spatial unpredictable configurations. The program performs a visual selection of the substructures in the viewpoint at a given time. Thus, constructs a linear sequence of the perception of what Artifex, as outsider, has from the mass of micro-programs. A user can act beyond this sampling, change the selection being made by the program.

This proposal explores the duality of self-organization as a spatial simulated process and the inherent linearity of the current computer systems. The "re-linealization" is done through the selection of substructures, which as a process external to the computation of the set of micro-programs, returns to the sequential world. Artifex constructs its history by collecting samples what happens in an abstract ecosystem, where millions of programs work unaware of their observer.

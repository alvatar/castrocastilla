Cellular automata are a computational / mathematical model able to define dynamic or complex systems with a very simple and intuitive set of rules. Composed of multiple cells that have only the information from their closest neighbors, they eventually “emerge” global behaviors only understood from a different level of perception. 

Neural networks, specifically those known as self-organizing maps have also emergent properties, although of a different nature: these neural networks organize its neurons so that each one is triggered by a range of stimuli (data) in the informational space.

Boceto de una Ciudad Generada (Generated Sketch of a City) is an experiment based on an investigation into the use of these two models (cellular automata and self-organizing maps) in the design of the city. The research process aimed at combining the properties of both models in a flexible, intuitive and visual algorithm. On one hand, self-organizing maps are very good at simplifying and reducing complex and spatial information to sets treated by a neuron or node. On the other hand, cellular automata are very good at describing in a simple way processes that occur at local scales, based on the interaction of cells or nodes.

Boceto de una Ciudad Generada shows how this process works, how the city would grow and would be reduced, how the creation of a city designed automatically would be experienced.

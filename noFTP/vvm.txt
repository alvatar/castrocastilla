The image of a universe composed of networks of vibrating strings or filaments is one of the areas of research in theoretical physics today. When I started working on a scenario of computational behavior based on recent developments in techniques for synthesis of artificial life, I found a number of concepts related to some of these physical theories, specially those trying to describe the universe as a fluid network of strings. Theoretical physics, genetics, a-life, among other fields served as a starting point to develop the abstract device that would eventually become Vacuum Virtual Machine. The term "virtual machine", in computing, refers to a software which simulates the operation of a physical computer, even if it has never been built.
VVM shows its internal mechanism of computing: a network that self-maps the internal structure of the program. As a result operates in a non-linear and emergent manner. The virtual machine comes to exist based on the "rhizomatic" code that configures the network structure, afterwards transformed into a sequential code and thus understood by a real computer. Operates grounded on three principles, inspired on the synthesis of artificial life:
  
  1) the configuration of the interconnections (called "intrinsic information"),

  2) the emergence of various substructures or clusters (the "partitioning" of the network or "emergence of membranes"),

  3) the re-configuration process (the "metabolism" of the system)
  
Thus, the virtual machine constantly generates new codes to modify itself, and even modify the position and viewpoint of the observer in relation to the visualized network.
This concepts explore a profound link between different knowledge areas, that could be understood through some highly abstract processes.

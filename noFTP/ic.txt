Human spatial perception is a 3D reconstruction of visual, tactile, aural stimuli. However, the ability to imagine more dimensions extends beyond our perception. In fact, mathematics and physics use consistently abstract devices that work in multiple dimensions.

IC_ is a work-or-tool which investigates the mental reconstruction of multidimensional spaces: a hypothetical extension of the ability to "see" in three dimensions.

The piece consists of a program that acts as data server-receiver, connecting other programs that generate or inject a stream of data. The communication protocol requires that data are particles, points or discrete information. Therefore, IC_ is acting without any knowledge of the meaning nor the origin of the data. Shapes shown in an arbitrary instant could be weather information, biological, or even random. In a system like this, any information is spatial and the temporal dimension is interchangeable with a spatial one. The total separation between the display and the displayed information suggests a reflection on the mind of modern research: the relationship between the three-dimensional perception of stimuli and the understanding of abstract information.

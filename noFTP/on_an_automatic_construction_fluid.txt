Self-built architecture configures itself without prior design, adapted to the many conditions that shape and create space. For this project, I idealize the current technology: the rapid development of new materials and the incorporation of dynamic qualities to them (adaptation to light and temperature, changes in texture, shape recovery ...) suggests me possible futures that we can already imagine. Beyond these technologies, On an Automatic Construction Fluid is a project that tries to approach the idea of fluid construction, through the use of materials yet to be invented. The resulting architecture is part of the world as a living being: subject to all laws of evolution of an ecosystem.

This virtual prototype is tested in the desert, where the boundary conditions are minimized, but could be anywhere. The design is completely conceptual, bringing us to the experience, exploring the object that evolves, grows and changes shape. The hypothetical performance of the construction fluid is defined by two factors: a ferrofluid substrate and programmable particles that generate electromagnetic fields. The ferrofluid changes its properties by regions, at the programmed particles' will. Through these changes, the particles move, disperse or form clusters, using the fluid as a means of transport.

This project tries to imagine a whole new world in architecture, where design is no mastered by architects, but constantly shaped as a living being by both its users and the environment -much more like in the origins-.

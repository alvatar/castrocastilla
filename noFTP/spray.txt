This is the result of applied research work between Dorlet and Alvaro Castro, Fran Gallardo and Carlos Cabañero, that developed from premises that were initially confined to the sphere of control and safety in domestic environments. Ready to reformulate a cascade of aspects close to the point of departure, the name Spray! Emerged as an ambivalent reference to action and diffusion: the most stable poles in the development of this investigation.

What is action-spray?
It is AFK, Away From Keyboard, or rethinking physical interface. Domotics is the first step towards ubiquitous computing, where action-thought replaces the interface, making it disappear from the user’s conscious processes. It is an unfinished search for more intuitive forms of relation with technological devices, recovering the immediacy of the primitive.

What is diffusion-spray?
It is the social dimension of interface, the architecture-atmosphere of communication or the environment of interrelations. It is the possibility of considering space as a seething mass of combinations of individuals and their desires, which together form a profoundly architectural rhizome. A network that spray! explores politically as algorithms of social organisation; and visually, as data flows that become obvious as they are shown.

With these new premises, the research has produced as a result a series of experimental artefacts, with different forms of interaction that use the actions and desires of an individual in order to socially process them. A centralised device collects this information and visualises the flow and simulation of "social algorithms" of spatial configuration.
